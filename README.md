## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Node SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vercel Hosting

### What I learned

Due to this challenge I was able to practice my newly accquired React skills to build a landing page.
Some of the Core topics on which I was able to decide while building this project are:

1. Which Components should be broken down and which of them can be reusable.
2. Where to store the state.
3. What changes when the state changes.

### Continued development

However this project wasn't that much successfull as I am still learning REACT and I don't know some of the various functionality of this library yet.

**I was not able to create the dropdown menu of the header section**

So, when I will accquire a little bit more knowledge of this JS Lib. , I will surely overcome this problem
and be able to create a successfull dropdown menu.
